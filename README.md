 Final Project CS 294 : 
 Deep Time Series Learning
##
In this project we explored a deep neural network based approach in order to forecast day ahead prices.
We used geospatial node pricing, oil/gas commodities prices, and weather data to come
up with day ahead price predictions, which were ended up improving on the utility
companyâ€™s accuracy. Using our best LSTM model, we managed to improve upon the
industry standard by an average $0.80 in prediction error.
